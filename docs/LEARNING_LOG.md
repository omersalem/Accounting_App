üéì Learning Log
This file is a step-by-step explanation of the code written for this project. Its purpose is to be a clear and simple guide for a beginner to understand how the React Native application is built.

Feature: [Name of the Feature, e.g., "Reusable Primary Button Component"]

1. What was the goal?
   (AI explains the goal. e.g., "The goal was to create a shared button component that we can reuse across the entire app, ensuring all our buttons look consistent.")

2. What files were created/modified?
   (AI lists the files.)

src/components/PrimaryButton.tsx

3. Code Explanation (File by File)
   File: src/components/PrimaryButton.tsx
   What this code does: This file defines a reusable React Native component called PrimaryButton. It accepts properties (props) like a title for the text and an onPress function to handle taps. It uses NativeWind classes for styling.

Why it's important: By creating this component once, we can use it everywhere. If we want to change the style of all primary buttons in the future, we only have to edit this one file.

Key Concepts:

Component: A reusable piece of UI.

Props (Properties): How parent components pass data and functions down to child components.

TouchableOpacity: A basic React Native component that makes any view respond properly to touches.

NativeWind (className): How we apply styles using Tailwind CSS classes.

(The AI will continue this pattern for every file and every new feature.)

Feature: Initial Navigation (POS, Stock) and Reusable PrimaryButton

1. What was the goal?
   Build the minimum app scaffold so the app can show multiple screens and navigate between them, and create a reusable PrimaryButton component styled with NativeWind so buttons look consistent everywhere.

2. What files were created/modified?
   Created:
   - src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
   - src/types/navigation.ts
   - src/components/PrimaryButton.tsx
   - src/screens/POS/POSScreen.tsx
   - src/screens/Stock/StockListScreen.tsx
   - src/screens/Stock/AddProductScreen.tsx
   - __tests__/components/PrimaryButton.test.tsx

   Modified:
   - App.tsx (use AppNavigator instead of inline StyleSheet)
   - index.ts (added react-native-gesture-handler import)
   - babel.config.js (added nativewind/babel plugin)
   - tailwind.config.js (at project root)
   - tsconfig.json (added nativewind types and jest types)
   - package.json (added jest preset and scripts)

3. Code Explanation (File by File)

   File: src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
   What this code does: Sets up the navigation using React Navigation‚Äôs native-stack. It declares three screens: POS, StockList, and AddProduct. This file also sets the initial screen to POS.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Navigation is how users move around the app. This centralizes the app routes in one place, making it easy to add new screens later.

   File: src/types/navigation.ts
   What this code does: Defines the TypeScript type for the stack parameters (RootStackParamList). Each screen name is listed with the parameters it expects (currently none).
   Why it‚Äôs important: Strong typing makes navigation safer and catches mistakes at compile time.

   File: src/components/PrimaryButton.tsx
   What this code does: A reusable button component styled with NativeWind classes. It accepts a title, onPress handler, and optional className overrides.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Ensures consistent button appearance and behavior across the app.

   File: src/screens/POS/POSScreen.tsx
   What this code does: A simple POS landing screen with two actions: navigate to Stock List and to Add Product, using the PrimaryButton.
   Why it‚Äôs important: It‚Äôs the starting point for cashiers to perform quick actions.

   File: src/screens/Stock/StockListScreen.tsx
   What this code does: A basic stock list using a FlatList to render a few mock items; includes a button to navigate to Add Product.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Demonstrates how we‚Äôll show inventory data in the future and provides a path to add new items.

   File: src/screens/Stock/AddProductScreen.tsx
   What this code does: A form to add a product (name, prices, quantity). It validates input and shows an alert on ‚ÄúSave‚Äù for now (persistence to be added later with Firebase).
   Why it‚Äôs important: Establishes the structure for data entry workflows used by warehouse staff.

   File: App.tsx
   What this code does: Replaced the template content and now renders the AppNavigator.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Makes navigation the entry point of the app.

   File: index.ts
   What this code does: Registers the app and imports react-native-gesture-handler (required by React Navigation).
   Why it‚Äôs important: Ensures proper gesture support and clean app bootstrapping.

   File: babel.config.js
   What this code does: Uses expo‚Äôs preset and adds nativewind/babel plugin to enable the className prop on React Native components.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Required for NativeWind to work.

   File: tailwind.config.js (project root)
   What this code does: Configures Tailwind/NaitveWind scanning for className usage in App and src.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Ensures all Tailwind classes used in components are recognized.

   File: tsconfig.json
   What this code does: Enables strict typing, adds nativewind typings, and includes jest types for tests.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Improves DX and prevents TypeScript errors in tests.

   File: __tests__/components/PrimaryButton.test.tsx
   What this code does: A simple test that renders the button and verifies onPress is called.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Establishes our testing pattern with React Native Testing Library.

4. Key Concepts
   - Navigation (Stack): A way to move between screens while maintaining a history.
   - Reusable Components: Build once and use everywhere to keep UI consistent.
   - NativeWind: Tailwind-style utility classes directly on RN components via className.
   - Testing: Use react-native-testing-library to render and interact with components in tests.

5. Current Status of Tests
   - All tests passing (2/2). The Jest/Babel transform issue was resolved by pinning compatible versions and disabling the NativeWind Babel plugin only in test via [babel.config.js](my-supermarket-app/babel.config.js:1).

Feature: Authentication, RBAC, and Guarded Navigation

1. What was the goal?
   Add Firebase Authentication (email/password), a role-based access control (Admin/Staff), and guard the navigation and UI so only authorized roles can perform sensitive actions (like adding products).

2. What files were created/modified?
   Created:
   - src/services/auth.ts
   - src/hooks/useAuthStore.ts
   - src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx
   - src/screens/Auth/SignInScreen.tsx
   - __tests__/screens/SignInScreen.test.tsx
   - __tests__/screens/StockListRoleGuard.test.tsx

   Modified:
   - src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx (auth gate + sign out)
   - src/screens/Stock/StockListScreen.tsx (Admin-only Add Product)
   - src/services/products.ts (Admin-only write guard)
   - src/hooks/useProductsStore.ts (load products from service)
   - my-supermarket-app/env.example (Firebase config placeholders)

3. Code Explanation (File by File)
   File: src/services/auth.ts
   What this code does: Wraps Firebase Auth for the app. Exposes helpers to sign in, sign out, get current user, and determine a user‚Äôs role from custom claims with a Firestore fallback.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Centralizes all auth logic and keeps the rest of the app simple and testable.

   File: src/hooks/useAuthStore.ts
   What this code does: A Zustand store that manages auth state (user, role, loading), initializes a listener for auth changes, and resolves the user‚Äôs role. Uses dynamic imports to keep Jest stable (avoids loading Firebase at module load time).
   Why it‚Äôs important: Provides a single source of truth for auth state across the app, and makes testing easier.

   File: src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx
   What this code does: A small Stack Navigator for auth-related screens, currently just SignIn.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Separates unauthenticated flow from the main app.

   File: src/screens/Auth/SignInScreen.tsx
   What this code does: A simple sign-in form with basic validation. Calls signInWithEmailPassword; auth listener handles routing on success.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Enables users to authenticate into the app.

   File: src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx
   What this code does: Uses the auth store to decide whether to show the Auth stack or the App stack. Adds a header ‚ÄúSign Out‚Äù action for authenticated users.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Provides an app-wide gate that ensures only authenticated users reach the main features.

   File: src/screens/Stock/StockListScreen.tsx
   What this code does: Loads products from the products store. Shows ‚ÄúAdd Product‚Äù only if the role is Admin; otherwise shows a ‚ÄúStaff role‚Äù label.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Demonstrates a role-based UI control for sensitive actions.

   File: src/services/products.ts
   What this code does: Adds a simple Admin-only guard for addProduct. Uses lazy require of Firestore helpers so tests remain stable and deterministic.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Provides a client-side guard aligned with our SECURITY.md; real enforcement is done in Firestore rules.

   File: src/hooks/useProductsStore.ts
   What this code does: Fetches products via listProducts and updates local state. Adds addProductLocal to support optimistic updates in the future.
   Why it‚Äôs important: Centralizes product state with a simple API.

4. Key Concepts
   - Auth Gate: Switches between Auth and App stacks based on auth state.
   - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Role is read from custom claims, with a Firestore fallback for local testing.
   - Client-side Enforcement: Services check role before writes; final enforcement is by Firestore rules.
   - Testing Stability: Use dynamic imports and minimal mocking to avoid ESM transform issues with Firebase.

5. Current Status of Tests
   - All tests passing (12/12). Added tests for SignInScreen and a role-guarded view on StockList. Existing component and service tests remain green.

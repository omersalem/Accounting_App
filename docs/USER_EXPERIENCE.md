âœ¨ User Experience (UX) Goals

1. User Personas (Our Target Users)
   Store Staff: Needs to quickly scan items, create invoices for customers, and process payments at the Point of Sale (POS). Speed and simplicity are key.

Warehouse Manager: Needs to add new products to the system, update stock levels, and manage supplier information. Accuracy is their top priority.

Accountant/Owner: Needs to view financial reports (daily sales, profit, etc.) and track customer debts. They need clear, easy-to-understand data.

2. Core User Journeys
   Fast Checkout (Store Staff): Open the POS screen -> Scan product QR codes using the camera -> The items are added to the invoice instantly -> Finalize payment in a few taps.

Adding New Stock (Warehouse Manager): Go to Stock Management -> Tap "Add New Product" -> Fill in details (name, price) -> The app automatically generates a unique ID for the QR code -> Save the product to the cloud.

Checking Daily Sales (Accountant): Open the Reports screen -> Select today's date -> Instantly see total sales, profit, and a list of all invoices.

3. Core UX Principles
   Scan-Centric: The QR code scanner should be easily accessible from the main screens.

Minimal Taps: Completing common tasks (like a sale) should require the absolute minimum number of screen taps.

Clear Feedback: The user should get instant visual feedback (e.g., a green checkmark) after a successful scan or save operation.

Helpful Alerts: The app should provide alerts for important events, like a product running low on stock.
